# Assignment 1

## Introduction

The assignments in KOLT Python Course are not going to be graded, but detailed feedback will be provided. This means that you don't have to ace the task; however, in order for you to get a certificate at the end of the program, we need to be convinced that you **did your best**.

Please don't see these assignments as regular class assignments. The main purpose of them is to get you practice what you have learned so far. Don't forget:

## Instructions

You need to create a game for this assignment. There is a specific item that will be auctioned. There are <ins>**two bidders**</ins> in the game, we call them **_Player A_** and **_Player B_**. The scenario is as follows:

- Each player (Players A and B) is privately assigned a random "valuation" for the item between 1 and 10.
- Their randomly assigned values are told to the players.
- Players then submit their bids for the item.
- The player with the highest bid obtains the item.
- The winner is announced and also each player's payoff is calculated and printed.

## Example Game

- Player A is assigned a random valuation of 5, and the Player B is assigned a random valuation of 6 for the auctioned item.
- Their randomly assigned values are told to the players.
- Players submit their bids for the item. For example, _Player A_ has a prize value of 5, so he can bid 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Likewise, _Player B_ can bid 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- _Player A_ bids 4 and _Player B_ bid 2, therefore _Player A_ wins.
- _Player A_ pays 4 for an item that has a prize value of 5. Therefore, _Player A_'s final payoff is 5-4=1. _Player B_'s final payoff is 0.
