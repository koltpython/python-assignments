### Your code starts here ###

# Make sure the proposer offers a valid amount, i.e, a value in range [0, total_amount]
# Continue to ask for new values until the proposer enters a valid amount


# Make sure the responder enters a valid response, i.e, 'yes' or 'no'
# Continue to ask for new response until the responder enters one of this legal values


# Notify users about the final allocation
